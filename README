I have been unsatisfied with previous means to run R from Perl,
and this is the beginnings of my attempt to rectify the issue.

Generally, you develop a template for your R, designate a temp
directory and file name for R code, and a hashref full of the 
data your R code will use. This module takes the data and template,
writes the R, then runs it. 

Because of how R works, we'd have to parse the .Rout file to see
if the R program worked. I don't currently do that. It is a place
where this module could do that. It probably should do that. It 
does not currently do that. I blame myself.

I would be more than willing to rectify this.
